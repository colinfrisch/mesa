"""Core event management functionality for Mesa's memory system.

This module provides the foundational data structures and classes needed for memory
entries recording in mesa. The Memory class is a manager between the ShortTermMemory
(dque data structure) and LongTermMemory (hash map).

The module contains three main components:
- Priority: An enumeration defining event priority levels (HIGH, DEFAULT, LOW)
- SimulationEvent: A class representing individual events with timing and execution details
- EventList: A heap-based priority queue managing the chronological ordering of events
